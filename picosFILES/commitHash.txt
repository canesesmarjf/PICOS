6922fdc we have included all the resampling code into PICOS and we are now testing and debugging. initial results show that it maintains approximately constant computational particle density, however, when the resolution of the PIC grid is smaller than the binary tree grid then it is hard to maintain true constant particle computational density. we however have had problems with Ex not finite. We have not confirmed that it all works well though
