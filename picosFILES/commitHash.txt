0e59466 Results show that we indeed need to average ncp_m over all MPI processes. Moreover, we corrected the pct_N_CP_MPI_output variable. This tells the user in the HDF5 output main what percentage of computational particles per MPI process are recorded. This is the final commit prior to creating a new branch to develop the resampling. Initial conditions development completed. Only observations is that at first time step, random number generator may be repeated over all MPI since there is correlation (strong) at start of sim.
